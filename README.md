# PySort

PySort is a highly customizable, optimized sorting algorithm visualization tool with Python Pygame.
As of now the only supported algorithm is [bubble sort](https://wekipedia.org/wiki/bubble_sort). Soon I'll add merge sort, quick sort etc.
(I know that one alg isn't very usefull but ill just publish it for now)

As I already mentioned it is highly customizable (**100%** tbh) so try tweaking stuff. You can edit the starting x, y position of the displayed array, the color of each bar, its width , and also screen size/background color and the sorting alg and speed
